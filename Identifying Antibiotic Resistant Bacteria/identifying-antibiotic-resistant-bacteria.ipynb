    "\n",
    "> We will be focussing on a species called <b><span style='color:#E888BB'>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</span></b>, the <b>bacteria which cause gonorrhoea</b>. <br>\n",
    "> Gonorrhoea is the second most common sexually transmitted infection (STI) in Europe, after chlamydia. <br>\n",
    "> Rates of gonorrhoea infection are on the rise, with a 26% increase reported from 2017-2018 in the UK.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Many people who are infected (especially women) experience no symptoms, helping the disease to spread. <br>\n",
    "> If the infection is left untreated, it can lead to infertility in women, and can occasionally spread to <br>\n",
    "> other parts of the body such as your joints, heart valves, brain or spinal cord. <br>\n",
    "> Resistance of these bacteria to antibiotics is rising over time, making infections hard to treat. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the past, patients were treated with an antibiotic called <b><span style='color:#E888BB'>ciprofloxaxcin</span></b>. \n",
    "- Doctors had to stop using this antibiotic because <b>resistance to the drug became too common</b>, causing treatments of infections to fail. \n",
    "- Until very recently, the recommended treatment was two drugs - <code>ceftriaxone</code> and <b><span style='color:#E888BB'>azithromycin</span></b>. \n",
    "- <b><span style='color:#E888BB'>Azithromycin</span></b> was removed from recommendations because of concern over <b>rising resistance to the antibiotic</b>.\n",
    "- In February 2018, the first ever reported case of resistance to treatment with <code>ceftriaxone</code> and <b><span style='color:#E888BB'>azithromycin</span></b>, as well as resistance to the last-resort treatment <code>spectinomycin</code>, was reported. \n",
    "- Currently in the UK, patients are only treated with <code>ceftriaxone</code>.\n",

    "### **<span style='color:#E888BB'>ANTIBIOTICS</span>**\n",
    "\n",
    "Three antibiotics and associated <b>unitigs</b> are used to make a model in this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Azithromycin</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "> Azithromycin is an antibiotic used to treat various types of infections of the respiratory tract, ear, skin and eye in adults and children. It is also effective in typhoid fever and some sexually transmitted diseases like gonorrhea.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Ciprofloxacin</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "> Ciprofloxacin is an antibiotic, used in the treatment of bacterial infections. It is also used in treating infections of the urinary tract, nose, throat, skin and soft tissues and lungs (pneumonia). It prevents the bacterial cells from dividing and repairing, thereby killing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Cefixime</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "> Cefixime is an antibiotic medicine used to treat a variety of bacterial infections. It is effective in infections of the respiratory tract (eg. pneumonia), urinary tract, ear, nasal sinus, throat, and some sexually transmitted diseases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **<span style='color:#E888BB'>UNITIGS</span>**\n",
    "\n",
    "In our dataset, we will come across features data that will convey the presence or absence of a particular <b>nucleotide</b> sequence in the <b>Bacteria's DNA</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "From <b>ML Workshop Starter</b> | [Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/nwheeler443/ml-workshop-starter-notebook)\n",
    "\n",
    "> For this analysis, we're using <b><span style='color:#E888BB'>unitigs</span></b>, stretches of DNA (in string format) shared by a subset of the strains in our study. <br>\n",
    "> Unitigs are an efficient but flexible way of representing DNA variation in bacteria. <br>\n",
    "> If you'd like to learn more about unitigs, and how this dataset was constructed, have a look at this [paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1007758). <br>\n",
    "> The full dataset consists of 584,362 unitigs, which takes a long time to train models on, so for this exercise <br>\n",
    "> we will be using a set that has been filtered for unitigs associated with resistance.\n",
    "\n",
